    - title: Unsolicited rebranding
      description: 
        - The existing visual identity no longer fitted in with. The primary colour was too dark. The accent colour too bright. That's why I took the liberty of making a proposal at the beginning of the design process. The client was happy with the new colour scheme.
        - Afterwards it turned out that a redesign process for the logo was already underway with another party. A little while after the launch I saw that they replaced it. Fortunately, they did keep the colours and typefaces.

      description: Askja asked me to renew their website from head to toe. A huge product database of travel experiences was a welcome starting point. An extensive card sorting session has served as the basis of the user experience.

    - title: Users landing
      description: Analytics showed us that users barely land on the homepage. Instead they come from a search engine on a country page directly. The challenge was to make that page feel like a home page – a soft landing.
