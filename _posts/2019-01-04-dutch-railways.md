    - title: NS Flex
      description: We had to deliver 3 campaign pages from scratch within a couple of months. That's lightning speed for a large enterprise like NS, so we had to use a different way of working than usual. In a pressure cooker with a marketer and UX designer I created a full responsive prototype. Which is been build as a static website by the development team. And it's a success! Sales were hitting target 2 months shy. While not cannibalizing classic subscriptions.
