    - title: NS Flex
      description: We had to deliver 3 campaign pages from scratch within a couple of months. That's lightning speed for a large enterprise like NS, so we had to use a different way of working than usual. In a pressure cooker with a marketer and UX designer I created a full responsive prototype. Which is been build as a static website by the development team. And it's a success! Sales were hitting target 2 months shy. While not cannibalizing classic subscriptions.

    - title: Spoordeelwinkel
      description: I participated in modernising the NS railway shop, a platform for the best deals for a day out by train. I was free to introduce a new design direction separate from the regular NS styling. Although it had to remain family of the NS brand. I took a bolder and more active approach to ensuring the feeling of being on offer.

    - title: Mijn NS
      description: I took part in redesigning the logged-in passengers environment of NS. This application contains a complicated backend to which numerous systems are linked. For me, the challenge was to present all information as clearly as possible while product owners were constantly scoping down functionality.
