      description:
        - With this latest redesign, Ziris and I wanted to go a step further. Bringing more than the usual functional page for viewing and registering courses. Ziris also wanted to inspire and tell about the why of a good photo. Looking a layer deeper than the technique. And reflecting that feeling in the concept of the website. We did this by asking well-known photographers to use their photos for the website. Poured into a website that radiates the feeling of a photo magazine.
